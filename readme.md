## Software
### Luban
Snapmaker Luban is a free, open source CAM software developed by Shenzhen Snapmaker Technologies Co., Ltd. and committed to software services related to allowing full controls over 3D printing, laser engraving / cutting, and CNC carving capabilities.

### Cura
Cura is also freem and is a popular alternative to the default Luban, but requires additional configuration to optimize use with SnapMaker 2.0.
If you know links to really good Cura/SnapMakeer configuraiton files, please post on the Issues page, or send me the info by email and I will add to this page.

Here is one Cura/SM configuration project by community member "Slynolds" on GitHub: https://github.com/slynold/snapmakerconfiguration

### OctoPrint
OctoPrint is a free, open source 3D print controller application. It was created by Gina Häußge who initially developed the software to support her first 3D printer in 2012. OctoPrint was forked from Cura, and is available under the same AGPL license. Development is hosted on GitHub.

## Filament (3D Printing)

### Filament types
The following list of filament types was initially extracted from the lengthy filament page at: https://all3dp.com/1/3d-printer-filament-types-3d-printing-3d-filament/
- PLA (Polylactic Acid) - The most popular 3D printer filament type.
- ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) typically ranks as the second most popular 3D printer filament, after PLA.
- PETG (PET, PETT)
- TPE, TPU, TPC (Flexible)
- Nylon
- PC (Polycarbonate)
- Wood
- Biodegradable (bioFila)
- Conductive
- Glow-in-the-Dark
- Magnetic
- Color-Changing
- Clay/Ceramic
- Carbon Fiber
- HIPS - "High Impact Polystyrene" is a copolymer that combines the hardness of polystyrene and the elasticity of rubber.
- PVA - "Polyvinyl alcohol" is soluble in water.
- Cleaning
- Wax (MOLDLAY)
- ASA "Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate" strong, rigid, and relatively easy to print with, ASA is also extremely resistant to chemical exposure, heat, and most importantly, changes in shape and color.
- PP (Polypropylene)
- PC-ABS "Polycarbonate ABS alloy" - a tough thermoplastic, combining the strength and heat resistance of polycarbonate with the flexibility of ABS. Commonly found in automotive, electronics, and telecommunications applications, it is one of the most widely used industrial thermoplastics in the world.
- POM (Acetal / Delrin) - well known for its use as an engineering plastic, for example in parts which move or require high precision.
- PMMA (aka Acrylic) - most often used as a lightweight, shatter-resistant alternative to glass.
- FPE (Flexible polyester) - A generic label given to a 3D printer filament that combines rigid and soft polymers. Such filaments are comparable to PLA, but are softer and more flexible. The specific flexibility depends on the hard and soft polymers used, and on the ratio between them.

## MDI Commands
You can send "MDI commands" to Snapmaker 2.0, even if you pause it in the middle of a print job. 

You can see a full list of the MDI commands here:
